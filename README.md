# bacon-api
backend service for bacon logic

> TODO: this whole thing 


### Chris Sheader may be poking around here so here is some info:

I mostly use this repo to test out ci/cd, swagger generating, workflows, and test-suits

I do have a Bacon Application I am working on that does pull some of this logic in: https://github.com/Shelrothman/bacon-app
